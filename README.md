---- My little Rendezvous with Nature ----

It was the second week of December on a cold Sunday morning. Got up early as i could not contain the
excitement that i was heading out to a place where i can embrace nature to its fullest extent, far far away
from the bustling cityscape into a calm, peaceful and remote location enclosed on all sides by
picturesque hills, glaciers and frozen lakes inviting you (and your soul too..) into a world of
tranquility, calm and peace.

Algonquin it is, struck my mind. The mere thought of checking off a long awaited bucket item gave me
my required boost. Checked with my friends if they are into this with me (bugged them literally),
and voila, they gave into my incessant tantrums (they were also willing to travel) and my travel bug
worked out. Plans were charted, camera gear set, playlist numbered, vehicle inspected, and off we go.

After two hours of drive down the Highway 400 N, we were invited with pleasant scene of trees in their white
winter clothing, shivering to the biting cold, branches adorned with snow, and with the roots buried
deep in the frozen earth they sleep, their branches dancing to the breeze, portraying a living art
regal in the brilliant sun-rays.

The road lay before us like a black velvet ribbon draped over gorgeous scenery in every
direction with yellow center lines throughout isolating us from harms way; albeit in stark contrast to the
white backdrop further tantalizing our young (at heart) blood, and challenge accepted!!, we weaved
down through the road while rolling the windows down to let the fresh cool breeze pamper your
soul from time to time and the heaters doing their best to keep us warm simultaneously (treated
ourselves to a spa session).

After battling the elements, we finally reached the visitor center. The exhibits there are simply
stunning, resembling real life artifacts which are used as time machines to transport your
soul back into the yesteryears. We were treated to a VIP session (only the 3 of us in the entire theatre) of the history of Algonquin and its rising to fame and how human encroachment has caused irreparable damage to the fragile ecosystem, and that it took us 'Homo Sapiens'  just a few hundred years to destroy what nature took millions, probably billions of years to create. Thoughts like these made me feel a little melancholy. What can i do, I am a small cog in the grand scheme of things. I conveyed my greatest thanks to the park personnel for neatly charting out everything.

Next up, we decided to click some pictures (incredible obviously) of the viewpoints and the ethereal surroundings, and it was simply a wow moment for us seeing the vast expanses of gorgeous frozen lakes adjacent to the colossal hills paving the way for a cross-country ski session (don't know how to ski unfortunately). Immersed in the breathtaking beauty, we forgot that time flies and that we did not have our lunch. Owing to Canadian winters, the sun chose to set early on us and we were forced to give a pause to this incredible journey and so we obliged and set back with tons of memories and pictures. 

Looking for every opportunity to revisit those wonderful sights and yes, with my faithful steed which never gave up on me especially during the winters, i will look out for every moment to immerse with nature.

This might be a little longer than anticipated. Thank you for your patience to read this small story of my experience with nature.
